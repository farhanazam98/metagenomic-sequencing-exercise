Obtain the high-level composition of the samples in the [Crits-Christoph et al. (2021)](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mbio.02703-20) study, which includes 18 raw sewage samples collected from wastewater treatment facilities in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am essentially reproducing the results from [Will’s notebook](https://data.securebio.org/wills-public-notebook/notebooks/2024-02-04_crits-christoph-1.html).
